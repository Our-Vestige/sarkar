  <div>A main memory consists of 64k words.
A cache memory consists of 128 blocks that is total size of the cache is 2048 words were each block consists of 16 words.
Direct mapping is implemented using BLOCK j % TOTAL NUMBER OF CACHE BLOCKS Where j means main memory block.
 Since the number of words in main memory is 64k therefore number of blocks in main memory is 64k/16=4096 blocks.
To address 4096 blocks 12bits is required.
Each block has 16 words to address that 4bits is required.
The total number of bits to access a word from main memory is 16bits(12+4).A main memory consists of 64k words.
